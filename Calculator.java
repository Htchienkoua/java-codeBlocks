//Create class named Calculator in the same package as before with main method to execute your program.
//Task:
//Using what you have learned create a calculator which will calculate figures perimeter and area.
// You must use switch statement for choosing a figure. Program should run as long as you want to continue using calculator.
// This means that after calculations are done it must ask if you want to run it again.
// You must check whether input values are correct if not write an error message that values were incorrect.
// Calculator must be able to calculate Triangle, Rectangle and Square perimeter and area.
//Input (happy flow): Rectangle 5 7
//Output: Rectangle perimeter is 24 and area is 35.
//Input (negative flow): Rectangle 0 7
//Output: Rectangle edge length canâ€™t be 0.
